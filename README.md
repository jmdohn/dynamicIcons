## Dynamic Icons in Lightning

This includes two lightning components: svg and dynamic icon.  

Dynamic icons stores the definitions contained on the [Lightninging Design System's Dyanmic Icon page](https://lightningdesignsystem.com/components/dynamic-icons).  

The SVG component allows for you to render any svgs dynamically by supplying a json formatted string.

To view the sample dynamic icons in action, install the package and go to https://[your-instance-name-here].lightning.force.com/c/svgMockApp.app.
